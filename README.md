# partyboat

Knowledge of the capability and features of different sensor and actuator technologies is key to being able to implement interactive systems. In this activity you are to use the sensors and actuators available to create a ‘PARTY BOAT’. The PARTY BOAT should include as many different types of sensors and actuators as you can fit onto an Arduino board. It should attract as much attention as possible by receiving input from the environment and then providing feedback with actuation.

Deliverables:
 - 1 Arduino-based PARTY BOAT
 - 1 Presentation with a demonstration of said PARTY BOAT
 -	1 Blog post of the PARTY BOAT project including:
  - 1+ Photo of the PARTY BOAT
  - 1 Video of the PARTY BOAT
  - 1 Description of the PARTY BOAT
 - 1 Subfolder in the partyboat GitHub repository in our ID6763Fall2016 organization with your PARTY BOAT software including:
  - 1 Arduino project folder per team
   - Arduino .ino file(s) with well commented code
   - README.md file documenting how to use the code and sensor hookup.

The in-class team presentations are scheduled for Thursday, September 1st, 2016, 12:05pm-1:25pm

Peer Evaluations are due Tuesday, September 6th, 2016 on the teammatesv4 site.

Documentation (i.e. Blog post and GitHub) are due Thursday, September 8th, 2016.
